Lab Exercise 8-Dice Project
I have been hired by devsInc to create a landing page for their new project. They want to support people playing tabletop games from home and require a Dice Generator.

Features
The user should be able to choose different dice, such as a D6 or a D10 (number or face)
The user should be able to roll their chosen dice to see the random outcome
Create the roll dice function by passing an argument, in order to reutilize the same function multiple times
Write a unit test for the roll dice function
